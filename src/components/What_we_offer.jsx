        The London School of Mathematics and Programming is a unique institution that helps children to develop their intellectual and cognitive skills. We provide classes and camps for ages 4 to 18 that explore and encourage a deeper understanding of Maths, Programming, Robotics and Chess.

Founded in 2013, we were the first school in the UK to offer Maths Circles where children solve and discuss maths problems in small groups led by senior mathematicians. Our goal is to provide children with a thorough understanding of maths and its related subjects, to enjoy learning and to develop enquiring minds. Academic success thus becomes the natural outcome of this experience rather than the only goal.
